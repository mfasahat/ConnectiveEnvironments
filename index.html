      <h3>Assignment 1- Flywheel Car</h3>
      <h5>Intro to Project:</h5>
            <p>This project was the disassembly and reassembly of a flywheel mechanical toy car to better understand the working mechanisms, and allow for the design of another prototype flywheel car. This project was conducted in the three four steps of disassembly, labeling and understanding the use of each part, reassembling to correct any mistakes/assumptions and finally taking the document parts from the original flywheel and using this knowledge to create another version of a flywheel car.</p>
              
            <h5>Disassembly:</h5>
                <p>In disassembling the parts we were to learn and document all parts that made up the vehicle, but gain the very basic understanding of how certain pieces start to act on one another. This knowledge was used to create the documented list of parts, and each part’s function.

    <h3>Liaison Graph</h3>
    <h5>Reassembly:</h5>
                <p>In reassembling the model a further understanding of how the parts worked was reached, as well as an understanding in which the order of assembly is in order for the flywheel car to be built. This step allowed for the creation of a liaison graph that demonstrated mostly how the parts physically met up and joined as constraints, but also started to look at how certain parts act on one another.

    <h3>Adjacency Matrix</h3>
    <h5>Virtual Model:</h5>
                <p>	With a greater understanding of the flywheel mechanism and how it can transfer energy from its wheels to its core, a prototype was 3D modeled on a computer. This demonstrated the knowledge gained from earlier exercise, by creating a flywheel car that could ideally run as well as snap together in an easy to assemble manner.</p>

          <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>	The work conducted helped to gain a better understanding of basic high impact parts in a mechanical system. This project showed how things cannot just be put together in any order, and well designed products have to have an easy to understand assembly as well as an easy to understand logic of parts. This disassembly and reassembly shows how parts interact in one another, just how many parts it can take to perform basic functions, and finally gained understanding in how energy can be transferred to a single part through multiple guided assemblies</p>
